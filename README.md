# Obsidian Dev Utils [![](https://badge.fury.io/js/obsidian-dev-utils.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/obsidian-dev-utils)

`Obsidian Dev Utils` is a collection of essential functions and CLI tools designed to streamline your Obsidian plugin development process. Whether you're building a plugin from scratch or enhancing an existing one, these utilities are here to simplify your workflow.

## What is Obsidian?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It's a tool that lets you take notes and organize them, and it supports a rich plugin ecosystem that allows for extensive customization.

## Who Should Use This Package?

This package is ideal for developers who are building or maintaining plugins for Obsidian. It provides a range of tools to make the development process easier, including automated builds, linting, spellchecking, and more.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install obsidian-dev-utils
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

The package offers several CLI commands to facilitate common development tasks:

#### Build Production Version

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils build
```

Compiles the production version of your plugin into the `dist/build` folder.

#### Clean build folder

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils build:clean
```

Cleans `dist` folder.

#### Build static assets

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils build:static
```

Copies `static` folder to `dist` folder.

#### Validate TypeScript build

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils build:validate
```

Validates if TypeScript code compiles.

#### Build Development Version

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils dev
```

Compiles the development version of your plugin into the `dist/dev` folder. The `OBSIDIAN_CONFIG_DIR` can be set either as an environment variable or specified in a `.env` file (e.g., `path/to/my/vault/.obsidian`). The command automatically copies the compiled plugin to the specified Obsidian configuration directory and triggers the [Hot Reload] plugin, if it is enabled. If the [Hot Reload] plugin is not installed, it will be installed automatically, and you will need to enable it manually.

#### Lint Code

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils lint
```

Lints your code, enforcing a code convention to minimize common errors.

#### Lint and Fix Code

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils lint:fix
```

Lints your code and automatically applies fixes where possible.

#### Spellcheck Code

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils spellcheck
```

Checks your code for spelling errors.

#### Version Management

```bash
npx obsidian-dev-utils version <versionUpdateType>
```

Runs build checks before updating the version and releases if all checks pass. The `<versionUpdateType>` can be `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `beta`, or a specific version like `x.y.z[-suffix]`.

#### Simplified Usage

To simplify the usage of these commands, you can add them to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "obsidian-dev-utils build",
    "build:clean": "obsidian-dev-utils build:clean",
    "build:static": "obsidian-dev-utils build:static",
    "dev": "obsidian-dev-utils dev",
    "lint": "obsidian-dev-utils lint",
    "lint:fix": "obsidian-dev-utils lint:fix",
    "spellcheck": "obsidian-dev-utils spellcheck",
    "version": "obsidian-dev-utils version"
  },
  ...
}
```

This setup allows you to run the commands using `npm run`, like `npm run build`.

### Helper Functions

`Obsidian Dev Utils` also provides a range of general-purpose and Obsidian-specific helper functions.

The functions are grouped by files and folders and you have multiple ways to import them:

```typescript
import { loadPluginSettings } from "obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian/Plugin/PluginSettings";
loadPluginSettings(() => ({ key: "defaultValue" }), { key: "newValue"});

import { PluginSettings } from "obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian/Plugin";
PluginSettings.loadPluginSettings(() => ({ key: "defaultValue" }), { key: "newValue"});

import { Plugin } from "obsidian-dev-utils/obsidian";
Plugin.PluginSettings.loadPluginSettings(() => ({ key: "defaultValue" }), { key: "newValue"});

import { obsidian } from "obsidian-dev-utils";
obsidian.Plugin.PluginSettings.loadPluginSettings(() => ({ key: "defaultValue" }), { key: "newValue"});

import * as obsidianDevUtils from "obsidian-dev-utils";
obsidianDevUtils.obsidian.Plugin.PluginSettings.loadPluginSettings(() => ({ key: "defaultValue" }), { key: "newValue"});
```
